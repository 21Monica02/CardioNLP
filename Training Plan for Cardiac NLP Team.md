Markup Training Plan
============

Following the training session on Friday, 06th May 2022, we will be placing a group of letters (Myocardial Perfusion Reports) onto a shared folder in the Z:\ drive. These letters will not be annonimised for the purpose of the study (we need to be able to annottate patient identifiers) and therefore they should not be moved from that folder. We would like you to annotate all the letters in Folder 1 ahead of meeting again two weeks after the initial session. This process will be repeated for folders 2 and 3.

| Session      | Date |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Feedback folder 1   | 20/05/2022; 14:00-15:00       |

The main aims of these sessions are:

  * Get everyone familiarised with Markup
  * Get feedback on the [config file](https://github.com/21Monica02/CardioNLP/blob/main/annotation.conf)

  * Update the config file based on feedback in time for the next session

We have created a [channel on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/cardionlp/shared_invite/zt-18dhs2uet-K29qN29BOSyjNTFttCsLDA) so that we can share questions and answers when issues arise.
